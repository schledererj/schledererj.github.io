# jack schlederer * professional software engineer
Hi! I'm Jack, a professional software and systems engineer based in the midwest USA. I joined [Direct Supply](https://www.directsupply.com) in 2015 as a part-time software engineering intern while still working on my undergraduate program and never left! These days, I'm a staff (level 3) engineer working on some impactful and exciting projects in the spaces of search, AI, and developer productivity. I earned a Bachelors of Science degree in computer engineering from Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) in 2018, and just this spring I graduated with my Masters of Science in machine learning from the same university. Read on for a short digest of my interests and proficiencies.
