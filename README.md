# schledererj.github.io

This repo houses a website where Jack Schlederer posts his musings on various items, including, but not limited to, software engineering, infosec, movies, soccer, data science, and booze (sometimes several at once). There's not much else to see here in the README file so get off here and go to the dang [website!!](https://schledererj.github.io)
